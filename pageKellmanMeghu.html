				"How Not To Do Security - Lessons Learned from the Galactic Empire"<br />
				Keynote Sponsor - Check Point Software Technologies<br />
				<span class="date">Wednesday Oct 23 | 12:00 PM</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Kellman Meghu is Head of Security Engineering for Check Point Software
				Technologies Ltd. Join him for a critique of the LucasFilm epic, from the
				perspective of a security audit. Let's review the security procedures and
				practices of the Galactic Empire, and see what they did well, but more
				importantly, learn from the mistakes they made.
			</p>
			<p>
				Prepare for a discussion on
				security policies and procedures, applied during the events that led to the
				catastrophic business impact the Galactic Empire suffered as the result of data
				loss. This data was then turned against the Empire, with an advance persistent
				threat that targeted, and eventually destroyed critical infrastructure. Then let us
				re-examine the situation with a proper security policy in place to understand how
				even the most basic policy approach, could have saved the Empires business,
				employee lives and ultimately billions of dollars.
