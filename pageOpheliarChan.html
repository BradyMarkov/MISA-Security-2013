				"Understanding and Developing a Mature Application Security Program"<br />
				<span class="date">Wednesday Oct 24 |11:00 AM – 12:00 NOON | Room 5 - Management Track</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Building an application security program can be daunting. Where do you start?
				What are the steps to building a mature program from the ground up? Many
				organizations never achieve a clear vision of what they want their program to
				look like, or what they need in a program to meet business needs, and therefore
				never have a clear plan of attack.
			</p>
			<p>
				Understanding the approaches and elements of a mature application security
				program is the key to seeing and dealing with the big picture – more importantly,
				knowing what you need, what you can get away with not having, and being able
				to grow the program over time will greatly assist in making the program a
				success.
			</p>
			<p>
				This presentation discusses the key elements of a mature application security
				program: what they are, why you should do them, when you should do them, and
				what value they offer. It will also cover the menu of security testing, security
				consulting services, and security training categories most often offered by
				vendors. The audience will be provided with a no-nonsense explanation of what
				each of these actually are, and how they fit in to and address the big picture.
