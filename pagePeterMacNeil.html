				"Risk Management: Where is the Information?"<br />
				<span class="date">Wednesday Oct 24 | 11:00 AM – 12:00 NOON | Room 1A - General Track</span>

				We have the tools and technology to secure our systems and infrastructure, but
				people remain the weakest link. How many unencrypted USB sticks does it take
				to cause a Privacy Breach? Or, someone misplaces corporate data containing
				personal, confidential or personal health information in the “Blue Bin” or using
				the auto-fill feature in e-mail and sending it to the wrong person. It only takes one
				instance and the Twitter World is a buzz; and then the lead headline in the news.
			</p>
			<p>
				We have diligently created build books for our systems, implemented change
				management, intrusion detection, disaster recovery plans and spent hours testing
				our system for potential security vulnerabilities. What about the people equation
				in all of this? The IT Security Team understands Information Security, but have
				you actually interviewed Senior Management and the Business Owners to
				understand what keeps them up at night? It may surprise many:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>An aging workforce with corporate history and knowledge that will
				disappear in the next 5 years</li>
				<li>Lack of fully documented processes and procedures</li>
				<li>Lack of Information Security Governance; more Transparency; Freedom
				of Information</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				Some of our greatest Information Security risks are People and what they do
				every day – Information Security is about behaviour and culture. Risk
				Management can assist in identifying the issues and Governance can assist in
				filling the gaps.
