				"Stopping Cross Contamination with NAC...The Ultimate Patch!"<br />
				<span class="date">Wednesday Oct 24 |11:00 AM â€“ 12:00 NOON | Room 1B - Technical Track</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				This session will highlight how Network Access Control is the ultimate patch
				checking system. By utilizing a set of key protocols, NAC will define and
				implement a policy that will define the access requirement for devices attempting
				to access your network. Those policies are designed to look for, among other
				things, pre-admission, endpoint security policy checks (such as antivirus or even
				patch levels) and post-admission controls over where users and devices can go
				on a network and what they can do. Bottom-line: we will discuss how NAC might
				integrate the automatic remediation process (fixing non-compliant nodes before
				allowing access) into the network systems, allowing the network infrastructure
				such as routers, switches and firewalls to work together with back office servers
				and end user computing equipment to ensure the information system is operating
				securely before interoperability is allowed.
			</p>
			<p>
				The key points of focus are:
			</p>
			<ol>
				<li>Mitigation of non-zero day attacks - The key value proposition of NAC
				solutions is the ability to prevent end-stations that lack antivirus, patches,
				or host intrusion prevention software from accessing the network and
				placing other computers at risk of cross-contamination.</li>
				<li>Policy enforcement - How to create a NAC policy and how to enforce
				that policy.</li>
				<li>Identity and access management - How NAC identifies a user.</li>
			</ol>
