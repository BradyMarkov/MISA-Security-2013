				Source code origination, application development practices and library
				management (code promotion) are examples of factors that, if left addressed,
				can result in deployed business functionality that is not only unstable and
				unreliable, but prone to attack and subversion as well. Given the methods,
				controls and countermeasures that, in combination, can be used to address
				these risks, this session will profile these components and their efficacy so that
				security related risks, associated with a wide, and diverse, set of code origination
				points, are managed and contained.
