				Stolen credentials, malicious web sites, zero-day malware are all types of threats
				that all organizations face on a daily basis. Throw on top of these new evolving
				cyber security challenges, the pressures placed on municipalities to do more with
				less, the ability to defend against these threats are even more challenging.
			</p>
			<p>
				In order to stem the tide against these threats, the City of Pickering has partnered
				with NCI to deliver world-class managed security services across the
				organization. It allows the City of Pickering to focus on supporting its clients on
				core business applications and services to keep the city running smoothly and
				efficiently.

				NCI is involved with maintaining wired and wireless network services, web
				content security and anti-spam technologies as well as proposing some of the
				latest threat detection and mitigation technologies for the City.
			</p>
			<p>
				In this session, we will describe some of the latest threats and attacks facing
				organizations today and how NCI managed security services can help defend
				against these attacks.
			</p>
