				"Enhancing Application Security Management with Security, Incident and Event Management (SIEM)"<br />
				<span class="date">Wednesday Oct 24 | 1:30 PM â€“ 2:30 PM | Room 1B - Technical Track</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				With the increasing demand on local and municipal government institutions for
				on-line access to public services and information, many applications that were
				once only for internal use, require modification or replacement to facilitate public
				access over the Internet. This transition is significantly impacting the security
				environment and requirements for local and municipal government institutions,
				and in combination with integrated payment processing, makes an attractive
				target for malicious users. This is especially true of local and municipal
				government systems, where sensitive information may be stored about
				individuals (i.e. tax information, home addresses) requiring the highest standards
				of protection.
			</p>
			<p>
				Application security is more than placing a firewall in front of an application
				before placing it into production. Achieving the standard of protection expected
				requires secure coding, patch management and other security best practices.
				Utilization of SIEM tools is becoming a key component for decreasing security
				risks. SIEM provides an institution the ability to identify suspicious activity in real
				time, as it happens, through security tool/application integration aligned to the
				risk profile of the systems.
			</p>
			<p>
				Nathan will be covering the following topics related to SIEM:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Overview of SIEM functionality and marketplace product offerings;</li>
				<li>Using SIEM tools to baseline application activity and detect anomalies in
				normal behavior;</li>
				<li>Integrating SIEM with patch management to enhance incident detection
				and alerting for unpatched systems;</li>
				<li>Integrating SIEM with vulnerability assessment to adjust incident
				response for identified vulnerabilities;</li>
				<li>Detecting cross platform attacks as they happen; and</li>
				<li>Activating system protection tools in real time response to suspicious
				events.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				The key activity is to design appropriate models and use cases to create the
				proper response scenarios that protect the application from malicious users while
				not hindering valid application usage.
			</p>
