				"The 5 Years of TELUS - Rotman Management School Study on Best Security Practices for Canadian Organizations"<br />
				<span class="date">Wednesday Oct 24 | 3:30 PM â€“ 4:30 PM | Room 1A - General Track</span>
			</p>
			<p>
				Every year, TELUS partners with The Rotman Management School U of T and
				performs an independent study on best security practices for Canadian
				organizations. It is the only Canadian based security report available to
				organizations in Canada today. We will review the last 4 years of results and
				compare and contrast that to the findings of this years qualitative report. The
				TELUS/Rotman study offers:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Original, Canadian research, based on the perspectives of government,
				public and private sector organizations</li>
				<li>Findings on emerging trends and technologies, including breaches,
				social networking, compliance risk, BYOD, and mobile security</li>
				<li>Points of view spanning the entire security organization from the
				executive to the IT manager-level.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>
				This year's study offers insights on:
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Has my organization been breached and I don't know about it?</li>
				<li>How will a breach affect my brand?</li>
				<li>What are my employees doing with corporate data?</li>
				<li>How do I retain my best IT security employees?</li>
			</ul>
