			<h2>Message from CAO Don Shropshire</h2>
			<p>
				Speaking on behalf of the administration of the Municipality of Chatham-Kent,
				let me say how very pleased and honoured we are by the opportunity to host the
				annual 2013 MISA Security Conference!
			</p>
			<p>
				In serving and engaging the citizens of our community, and in constantly
				improving our service, we depend very heavily on the vision, expertise,
				professionalism, and kinds of information systems that are your daily business.
				That you have chosen Chatham-Kent as the setting for your conference is a fine
				complement to our community. I have confidence that we will come to know each
				other much better and benefit by the shared knowledge and exciting new
				opportunities this conference presents.
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for this great opportunity!
			</p>
			<p>
				Sincerely,
			</p>
			<p>
				<b>Don Shropshire</b><br />
				Chief Administrative Officer<br />
				Municipality of Chatham-Kent
