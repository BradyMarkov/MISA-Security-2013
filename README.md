==================

This app is the portable MISA Security Conference 2013 program Guide and Map.

Using Sparkle http://sparkleshare.org/ the git repo is sync with the Web Site, all commits will upload to the server.
Have not tested the time it take it seem pretty quick.

I rearranged the page content into separate pages so that we can easily have another person update the content portions.
For example we can setup a simple Content Management which allows another person to update the program.
