			<p>
				Welcome to the Municipality of Chatham-Kent and the 2013 MISA Security Conference: Application Security - There's a Patch for That!
			</p>
			<p>
				The conference team has worked hard to put together a program that we hope you find interesting, entertaining and educational.  The three keynote sessions and nine breakout sessions offered in three tracks - General, Technical and Management - provides opportunities to learn the latest in application security trends and practices.  The schedule of events, activities and entertainment will hopefully facilitate peer networking, discussions, friendships and most of all, fun!  (You may even witness a pirate or two stalking the halls!)
				The combined abilities and efforts of our ITS team, along with support from the MISA Executive have provided for a conference that I hope you all enjoy, which would not be possible without the generous support of our vendors and sponsors!
			</p>
			<p>
				Thank you for joining us in Chatham-Kent!
			</p>
			<p>
				With best wishes,
			</p>
			<p>
